## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository, inspect the code,

### Getting started

####Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ngrok http 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.

FOR VIEWER:
####Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html
Where are two code directories in my repository - source and public. Source contains the original files and public contains modified files. For the first part of the project (index.html) I included changed, but not minified index.html into source directory for viewer to be clear what changes I did make (I assumed to read minified file is to hard also you can find original code is forked from github repository).
PageSpeed shows me 93/100 and 91/100 scores for index.html page when using ngrok. Steps I did for reaching this score are:
optimissing images, minifying files, adding css inline, add "async" to js files, add "print" media for css file, put google font script at the end of page.

####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html
I was using chrome developer tool - timing to measure the FPS and optimise. Same as part one source code contains changed, but not minified pizza.html and main.js file. At the moment it shows that average FPS is 60 and Average time to generate last 10 frames is around 0,1-0,3. Steps I did to inscrease FPS in main.js:
optimise images, minifying files, fixed updatePositions and changePizzaSizes functions: cleaned the loops and reduced the number of pizzas from 200 to the number based on screen size. Also replaced querySelectorAll to getElementsByClassName and querySelecor to getElementById, removed variables from the loop where possible.

Thank you!
